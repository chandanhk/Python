Using Python External & Built In Modules
In Python a module can be defined as a file containing a runnable python code. The extension used by modules in Python is .py. Hence any simple file containing Python code can be considered a module if its extension is .py. The file and module names are the same; hence we can call a module only by name without using the extension. Along with this, a module can define functions, classes, and variables.

There are two types of modules.

Built-in
External
Built-in Modules:
            Built-in modules are already installed in Python by default. We can import a module in Python by using the import statement along with the specific module name. We can also access the built-in module files and can read the Python code present in them. Newly integrated modules are added in Python witch each update. 

Some important modules names are as follows

Modules Names

Purpose

calendar

used in case we are working with calendars

random

used for generating random numbers within certain defined limits

enum

used while working with enumeration class

html

for handling and manipulating code in HTML

math

for working with math functions such as sin, cos, etc.

runpy

runpy is an important module as it locates and runs python modules without importing them first

 

External modules:
            External modules have to be downloaded externally; they are not already present like the built-in ones. Installing them is a rather easy task and can be done by using the command “pip install module_name” in the compiler terminal. Being familiar with all the modules seems like a long shot for even the best of programmers because there are so many modules available out there. So, we can search and find modules according to our needs and use them as there is no need to remember all of them when we can simply look for them on the internet when the need occurs.

Being programmers, modules makes our life a lot easy. Unlike programming languages in the past, also known as low-level programming languages, Python provides us with a lot of modules that makes our coding much easy because we do not have to write all the code ourselves. We can directly access a module for a specific task. For example, to generate a random number within two numbers, known as its limit, we do not have to write a function ourselves with loops and a large number of lines of codes. Instead, we can directly import a module, and this makes our work simple.

We should not concern ourselves with the code written inside the module; instead, we can search the internet for the functions and properties. If we are not satisfied with the available module's work or could not find a module that could help us in the required manner, we can create our own module by making a file with .py extension. The module file will be like any other file you see in Python, the difference will just arise in the extension.

#######TOP 30 Modules Of Python####

1> import Pillow  #Pillow is actually a fork of PIL – Python Image Library.
Features Of Pillow

"""Using Pillow, you can not only open and save images but also influence the 
environment of images as well. Pillow supports a lot of file types such as PDF,
 WebP, PCX, PNG, JPEG, GIF, PSD, WebP, PCX, GIF, IM, EPS, ICO, BMP, and many others 
as well. With Pillow, you can easily create thumbnails for images. Thumbnails bear
most of the valuable aspects of your image. Pillow supports a collection of image
filters – FIND_EDGES, DETAIL, SMOOTH, BLUR, CONTOUR, SHARPEN, SMOOTH_MORE, and
others.Pillow offers great support from the community who are eager to answer,
 challenge, and work through any of your inquiries."""


2>import Numpy
Numpy is a popular array – processing package of Python. It provides good 
support for different dimensional array objects as well as for matrices.
 Numpy is not only confined to providing arrays only, but it also provides
  a variety of tools to manage these arrays. It is fast, efficient, and really
   good for managing matrice and arrays.

3>import Requests
Requests is a rich Python HTTP library. Released under Apache2.0 license,
Requests is focused on making HTTP requests more responsive and user-friendly.
 This python library is a real blessing for beginners as it allows the use of 
 most common methods of HTTP. You can easily customize, inspect, authorize, and 
 configure HTTP requests using this library.

x=platform.system()
print(x)

5>import math
squre=math.sqrt(5)
print(5)

6>import datetime
dat=datetime.datertime.now()
print(dat)


import time

initial=time.time()
print(initial)
