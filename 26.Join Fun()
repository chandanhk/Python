The join() method is a string method and returns a string in which the elements of sequence have been joined by str separator.

Syntax:

string_name.join(iterable) 

string_name: It is the name of string in which
             joined elements of iterable will be
             stored.
Parameters: The join() method takes iterable â€“ objects capable of returning its members one at a time. Some examples are List, Tuple, String, Dictionary and Set

Return Value: The join() method returns a string concatenated with the elements of iterable.

Type Error: If the iterable contains any non-string values, it raises a TypeError exception.
